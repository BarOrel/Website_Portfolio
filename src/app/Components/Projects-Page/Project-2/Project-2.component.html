           <h3>Overview</h3>
           <p>An e-commerce website using ASP.NET and Angular would provide a robust and user-friendly platform for customers to browse and purchase products. The website would feature a homepage displaying featured products, categories, and special offers. Users would be able to search for specific products and filter their search results based on various criteria such as price, brand, and category.</p>

           <p>The website would include a user registration system, allowing customers to create accounts and save their shipping and payment information for future purchases.

           <p>The website would also include an admin panel for managing product listings, inventory, and orders. The admin panel would allow the store owner to add new products, update product information and images, and manage product inventory. Additionally, the admin panel would provide order management functionality, enabling the store owner to view and process customer orders.</p>
